[Intro]
SESH

[Verse 1]
Smoking like a motherfucker, higher than a motherfucker
Bitch, please stop the playing
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, deaf to them other boys
We can't hear a word you saying
We don't know your name, can't hang with the gang
Crowd jumping when the bass get banging
All I need is dope, so I gotta get paid
Never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
My hair 1080, my teeth 240, my blunts 4K
And my dope you couldn't load it
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

[Chorus]
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
